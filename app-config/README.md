## Environment based application configuration using Webpack

In this example, I use [`node-config`](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) and [webpack's DefinePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/)
to feed environment based configuration into my application.

This allows me to separate API URLs, access codes, feature flags,
etc based on the environment.
